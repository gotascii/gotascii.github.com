<p>Me and my esteemed colleague, <a
href="http://www.viget.com/about/team/mswasey">Matt Swasey</a>, just wrapped up
the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/rubyhacknight/calendar/11696332/">third
Hackday</a> at <a href="http://viget.com">Viget Labs</a>. For this Hackday we
led a discussion surrounding the mind-altering world of meta-programming. You
can read a detailed summary of the event on the <a
href="http://www.viget.com/extend/hackday-intro-to-ruby-meta-programming/">Viget
Extend blog</a>. You can also take a look at the code and notes we put together
on <a href="http://github.com/gotascii/metaprogramming">GitHub</a>.</p>
