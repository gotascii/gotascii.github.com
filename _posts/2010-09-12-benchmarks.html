title: Handlebars.js & Mustache.js Benchmarks
excerpt:
  <p><a href="http://yehudakatz.com">Yehuda Katz</a> just released
  <a href="http://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js">Handlebars.js</a>, a compiled
  javascript <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache</a> implementation,
  similar to <a href="http://github.com/janl/mustache.js">Mustache.js</a> with
  some useful additional features. The <a href="http://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/README.markdown">README</a>
  mentions,</p><blockquote>
    "In a rough performance test, precompiled Handlebars.js
    templates rendered in about half the time of Mustache templates. It would be a
    shame if it were any other way, since they were precompiled, but the difference
    in architecture does have some big performance advantages."

  Interested in the specifics, I did some benchmarking based on Brian Landau's
  <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/benchmarking-javascript-templating-libraries/">Benchmarking Javascript Templating Libraries</a>
  and came up with the following results.
  <img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chxl=1:|ms&chxp=1,50&chxr=0,0,1000&chxt=y,y&chbh=a,15&chs=500x300&cht=bvg&chco=FFCC33,FF9900,3072F3,224499&chds=0,1000,0,1000,0,1000,0,1000&chd=t:98|202.5|309.2|889.8&chdl=Simple+Handlebars|Simple+Mustache|Loop+Handlebars|Loop+Mustache&chtt=Handlebars.js+%26+Mustache.js+Benchmarks" />
</p>

<p>I made some tweaks to the overall benchmarking approach, isolating the actual
template rendering from any DOM manipulation and removing the setTimeout
mentioned in <a
href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/08/when_to_read_ou.html">PPKâ€™s
benchmarking methodology</a> as it was no longer necessary. The time it took to
render the template 5k times was recorded and averaged out over 10 tries. Not
terribly scientific, but hopefully good enough to show that in both simple and
iterative cases Handlebars.js is about 2x as fast. The code I used to achieve
these results is in my <a
href="http://github.com/gotascii/js-templates-benchmark">js-templates-benchmark</a>
repo.</p>
