title: Distributing Your Data
excerpt:
---
This weekend I gave a presentation at <a href="http://devnation.us/events/10">Devnation Portland</a> on some of the concepts behind distributed data stores.  You can checkout the slides on <a href="/talks">my talks page</a> or you can <a href="http://github.com/gotascii/talks/raw/master/distributing_your_data/distributing_your_data.pdf">download the PDF</a>. Thanks to all the speakers and to everyone who came out! I had a great time and I'll definitely be attending, and hopefully speaking, at another Devnation event in the near future.
