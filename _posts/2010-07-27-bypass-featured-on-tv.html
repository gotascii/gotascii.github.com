title: Bypass Featured on TV
excerpt:
---
<p>I'm currently the lead developer on a mobile web application that was just
featured on <a href="http://www.kvue.com/">KVUE</a> in Austin, Texas. The app
has been amazing to work on as it's provided a host of challenges I've never
faced before. The service the app provides is even more exciting as I'm a
die-hard <a href="http://redskins.com">Redskins</a> fan and have spent my fair
share of time standing in line at FedEx Field. You can check out the details on
the official <a href="http://bypasslane.com">Bypass Lane Website</a> or you can

Bypass TV clip on the KVUE website</a>.</p>
